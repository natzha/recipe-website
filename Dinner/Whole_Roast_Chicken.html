<h1>Whole Roast Chicken</h1><h2>Notes</h2><p>I invented a pseudo chinese style stuffing to go with this chicken. Reminiscent of Mongolian Rice. </p><h2>Ingredients</h2><h3>Main</h3><p>Whole XL Chicken, 2kg<br>Butter, 3cm^3 block ish, 200g ish, doesnt really matter too much<br>Herb assortment (Rosemary, Thyme, Sage, Parsely are good picks. Once again no one definitive set that has to be used)<br>Garlic, 1 head<br>Olive oil<br>Lemon Juice<br>Onion, 1 and a half medium<br>White Wine, 2 good glugs<br>Leftover Rice, 1 cup<br>Carrot, 1 </p><h3>Other</h3><p>Salt n Pep </p><h2>Method</h2><ol> <li>Take chicken out of fridge a few hours beforehand to bring it to room temp. Preheat oven to 190C </li> <li>Make a herb butter by softening butter, adding 2/3 of the finely chopped herb assortment and garlic, salt, pepper, little squirt of lemon juice. </li> <li>Make stuffing using old rice, finely diced carrot and half a onion also diced. </li> <li>Using a small spatula or chopstick, separate the skin from the meat on the breast and backside. Take care not to rip the skin. </li> <li>Get down and dirty with it and spread the button OVER the meat and UNDER the skin. </li> <li>Mix olive oil with remainder of the herbs, garlic, some salt and pepper and rub it on the OUTSIDE of the skin </li> <li>Slice a whole medium onion in rings and lay on the bottom of a baking tray. </li> <li>Place chichen ontop, breast up and fill cavity with "stuffing". Dont worry about sealing the cavity with butchers twine or something, this is home cooking its ok if it falls out a bit. Just eat it over the sink like a rat. </li> <li>Pour 2 glugs of white wine and small squeeze of lemon juice onto the tray and bake in oven on lowest rack for 2 hours, basting every hour. Note I need to use bottom rack or else skin will burn before chicken is cooked through. I don't really time the chicken either, when the skin at the top is nice and crispy, the whole chicken is also about done at the same time. Works out nicely </li> <li>Remove chicken and wrap in foil to rest for 20-30 mins. </li> <li>Make a sauce by slowly reducing all the liquid and fat in the bottom of the pan.</li> </ol>
