const n=`# Brown Butter Dark Choc Cookies

## Notes
Makes 16ish depending on size  
Butter goes from foamy to browned very quickly and its hard to see under all the foam. Just keep an eye and nose on it. Stop it when its just starting to brown and leftover heat will finish the browning. Dont wanna burn it.
