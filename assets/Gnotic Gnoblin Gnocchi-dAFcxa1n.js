const n=`# Gnotic Gnoblin Gnocchi

## Notes

## Ingredients
### Main
Floury Potato,  2 large  
Egg,  1 large  
Flour, 2 cups  

### Other
Butter,  approx 100g  
Sage,  1 coles packet

## Method
1. Wash potatoes and poke holes in them with a fork to help cook the insides.  
2. Cook the potatoes whole for 45 minutes.  
3. Peel the potatoes and mash using a fork, ricer or grater in a large bowl.  
4. Add 1 egg and flour in small batches.  
5. Knead the dough, adding flour as needed until it forms a soft but not sticky dough. Flour volume depends a lot on water content of potatoes, eggs, etc.  
6. Cut the dough out into logs and chop into gnocci sized pieces.  
7. Boil the gnocci in heavily salted water until they start floating.  
8. Brown butter and sage in a large, non-stick pan.  
9. Add gnocci and leave undisturbed until water has evaporated and one side is well browned and crunchy.  
10. Flip the gnocci and brown the other side, add more butter if needed.  
11. Season with salt and pep and serve.  `;export{n as default};
