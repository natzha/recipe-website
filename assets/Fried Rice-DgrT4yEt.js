const e=`# Fried Rice

## Notes
Perfect dish for using up whats left in the fridge. If no old rice is available, you can cook rice, spread it out on a plate and cool it in the fridge for an hour. Make sure you spread the rice out as thin as possible to get rid of the moisture. Use slightly less water than usual when cooking.   
Highly tests wok skills in properly seasoning and tossing so rice doesnt stick. Be generous with oil.  
The choice of protein can include: beef, chicken, bacon, spam, seafood or sausage. Be creative.  
Veges are not limited to these and you can add literally anything. Just make sure to dice them finely.  

## Ingredients
### Main
Leftover Rice,   1 cup uncooked worth  
Egg,    2 lightly beaten
Protein,    150-200g  
Carrot,     1  
Peas,   small handful  
Onion,  1 small  
Garlic,     3-4 cloves

### Other
Oil,  
Sesame oil,  
Salt,  
White Pepper,  
Msg,  
Chicken Boullion Powder,  
Scallion, 1 large,  

## Method
1. Finely dice all vegetables and set aside.
2. Fry eggs and set aside.
3. Fry garlic, onions and carrots until softened. Set aside
4. Fry protein. Set aside
5. Combine everything thats been fried so far and toss to combine. Season with salt, white pepper, msg and chicken powder. Set aside
6. Heat wok until extremely hot, add oil and coat the wok. Add in rice and stir-fry aggressively, breaking up any lumps
7. Drizzle soy sauce ALONG THE EDGE OF THE PAN (not on the rice) so that the soysause hits the hot wok. This reduces the water content and also makes it way more aromatic.
