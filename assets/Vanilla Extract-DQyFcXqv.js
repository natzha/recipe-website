const a=`# Double Fold Vanilla Extract

## Notes
Needs about 6 months so its a long project. Make sure you use cleaned and sanitised (can just use boiling water) glass bottles with a seal. Use at least 80 proof/40% alcohol by volume vodka. Alternatively experiment with rums and brandys. 

## Ingredients
### Main
B-Grade Madagasgar Vanilla Bean,    45g  
Unflavoured vodka,  1 cup (250ml)  
### Other
Airtight jar/bottle/container  
## Method
1. Clean jar and sanitise with boiling water.  
2. Split vanilla beans in half, and cut into lengths to that they fit in the vessel.  
3. Place beans in jar and add vokda, top up with more vodka/beans until the beans are completely submerged.  
4. Wait for 6 months, shaking approx once a week.  
5. Enjoy :).  `;export{a as default};
