<h1>Fried Rice</h1><h2>Notes</h2><p>Perfect dish for using up whats left in the fridge. If no old rice is available, you can cook rice, spread it out on a plate and cool it in the fridge for an hour. Make sure you spread the rice out as thin as possible to get rid of the moisture. Use slightly less water than usual when cooking.<br>Highly tests wok skills in properly seasoning and tossing so rice doesnt stick. Be generous with oil.<br>The choice of protein can include: beef, chicken, bacon, spam, seafood or sausage. Be creative.<br>Veges are not limited to these and you can add literally anything. Just make sure to dice them finely. </p><h2>Ingredients</h2><h3>Main</h3><p>Leftover Rice, 1 cup uncooked worth<br>Egg, 2 lightly beaten Protein, 150-200g<br>Carrot, 1<br>Peas, small handful<br>Onion, 1 small<br>Garlic, 3-4 cloves</p><h3>Other</h3><p>Oil,<br>Sesame oil,<br>Salt,<br>White Pepper,<br>Msg,<br>Chicken Boullion Powder,<br>Scallion, 1 large, </p><h2>Method</h2><ol> <li>Finely dice all vegetables and set aside.</li> <li>Fry eggs and set aside.</li> <li>Fry garlic, onions and carrots until softened.
