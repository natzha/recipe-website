<h1>Chicken Karaage</h1><h2>Notes</h2><p>Makes enough for about 3 Cary servings</p><h2>Ingredients</h2><h3>Main</h3><p>Chicken Thigh (skin on best), 1000-1200 grams<br>Salt, 1 tsp<br>Grated Ginger, 1 tsp<br>Garlic, 2 cloves miced/grated<br>Soy Sauce, 1 Tbsp<br>Cooking Sake, 1 Tbsp<br>Potato Starch, prepare around 2 Cups (may not need all of it)<br>Neutral Frying Oil (vegetable, canola, sunflower), 1 Litre </p><h3>Other</h3><p>Black Pepper<br>Japanese Mayo<br>Japanese Chilli Powder </p><h2>Method</h2><ol> <li>Cut chicken into slightly larger than bite size pieces. They will shrink when they cook so cut them bigger. </li> <li>Put into a large bowl along with salt, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, cooking sake. Crack in black pepper to taste (go hard on the pepper). </li> <li>Marinate for at least 20 mins, preferably for a few hours or even overnight. </li> <li>Start heating up your frying oil. We are double frying so first fry doesn't have to be too hot. Soak a wooden chopstick in water and it should bubble lightly when it is put in the oil. </li> <li>Prepare a large tray/plate and bowl. Fill bowl with 1 cup potato starch. </li> <li>Working with about 4 pieces at a time, let the chicken drip excess liquid back into the marinating bowl and put the chicken in the potato starch bowl and coat. </li> <li>Spread the chicken out in 1 layer on the tray. </li> <li>Let chicken sit for 5 mins, potato starch will draw liquid off the chicken and air dry. </li> <li>Dust the chicken with potato starch again to coat any areas that are a bit wet/have no coating. </li> <li>Place a wire rack over a tray lined with paper towels. This is the drip tray so its gonna get oily. </li> <li>Fry about 8 pieces of chicken at a time for about 5 until cornstarch is set and just starting to colour. You should notice it start to bubble heavily as inside starts to cook and water evaporates out. </li> <li>Let it drip over the wire rack and repeat the frying for the rest of the chicken. </li> <li>Heat the oil up until a soaked chopstick bubbles heavily when its put in the oil. </li> <li>Re-fry the chicken for about 3 minutes until the outside is a golden brown. </li> <li>Season with japanese chilli powder and serve with japanese mayo.</li> </ol>
