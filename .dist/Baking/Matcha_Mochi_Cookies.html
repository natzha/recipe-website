<h1>Matcha Mochi Cookies</h1><h2>Notes</h2><p>The method was written months after the cookies were made so i dont really remember how i did it lmao.<br>I used regular glutinous rice flour but you will probably get better mochi if you use flour specifically for mochi like mochiko. </p><h2>Ingredients</h2><h3>Main</h3><h4>Cookie</h4><p>Flour, 180g<br>Butter (softened), 100g<br>Brown Sugar, 100g<br>Egg, 1 large<br>Matcha Powder, 2 tsp<br>Baking Soda, 1 tsp<br>Choc Chips, about 5 per cookie, just get a small bag </p><h4>Mochi</h4><p>Glutinous Rice Four, 6 tbsp (50g)<br>Corn Starch, 4 tsp<br>White Sugar, 4 tsp (20g)<br>Milk, 1/3 cup<br>Butter, 1 Tbsp (15g) </p><h2>Method</h2><ol> <li>Preheat oven to 180C. </li> <li>Mix the glutinous rice flour, sugar and milk in a microwave safe bowl. </li> <li>Microwave in 30 second increments until solid. You can stop when its just about all solid, carry over cooking will cook the remaining. </li> <li>Get a large rolling pin or similar instrument you can bash the mochi with. Pound it for 5 mins while incorporating butter to develop its chewiness. </li> <li>Transfer from bowl onto a cornstarch lined tray. Coat both sides with cornstarch to prevent drying out. </li> <li>Whisk butter sugar and egg in a large bowl. </li> <li>Sift in flour, baking soda and matcha powder. Fold with a spatula to combine. </li> <li>Make a little ball of mochi and envelop it in the cookie dough. </li> <li>Gently press it down into a disk and push some choc chips in. </li> <li>Bake until cooked, forgot how long I baked for.</li> </ol>
