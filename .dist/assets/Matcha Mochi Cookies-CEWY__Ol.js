const o=`# Matcha Mochi Cookies\r
\r
## Notes\r
The method was written months after the cookies were made so i dont really remember how i did it lmao.  \r
I used regular glutinous rice flour but you will probably get better mochi if you use flour specifically for mochi like mochiko.  \r
## Ingredients\r
### Main\r
#### Cookie\r
Flour,  180g  \r
Butter (softened),  100g  \r
Brown Sugar,  100g  \r
Egg,  1 large  \r
Matcha Powder,  2 tsp  \r
Baking Soda,  1 tsp  \r
Choc Chips,  about 5 per cookie, just get a small bag  \r
#### Mochi\r
Glutinous Rice Four,  6 tbsp (50g)  \r
Corn Starch,  4 tsp  \r
White Sugar,  4 tsp (20g)  \r
Milk,  1/3 cup  \r
Butter,  1 Tbsp (15g)  \r
\r
## Method\r
1. Preheat oven to 180C.  \r
2. Mix the glutinous rice flour, sugar and milk in a microwave safe bowl.  \r
3. Microwave in 30 second increments until solid. You can stop when its just about all solid, carry over cooking will cook the remaining.  \r
4. Get a large rolling pin or similar instrument you can bash the mochi with. Pound it for 5 mins while incorporating butter to develop its chewiness.  \r
5. Transfer from bowl onto a cornstarch lined tray. Coat both sides with cornstarch to prevent drying out.  \r
6. Whisk butter sugar and egg in a large bowl.  \r
7. Sift in flour, baking soda and matcha powder. Fold with a spatula to combine.  \r
8. Make a little ball of mochi and envelop it in the cookie dough.  \r
9. Gently press it down into a disk and push some choc chips in.  \r
10. Bake until cooked, forgot how long I baked for.  \r
