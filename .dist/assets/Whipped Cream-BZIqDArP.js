const e=`# Whipped Cream

## Notes
Makes a lot  
Make this right before serving and try not to serve it on anything hot  
Use the largest bowl and largest whisk you have to speed up the process  

## Ingredients
### Main
Heavy cream,    1 cup  
Sugar,  1 tablespoon  
Vanilla essence,    1 teaspoon  
### Other

## Method
1. Add cream and sugar into a bowl
2. Whisk vigorously until stiff peaks are just about to form. You should be able to invert the bowl and nothing will move.
3. Add in vanilla essense and finish whisking. Don't overmix as you will make butter and buttermilk.`;export{e as default};
