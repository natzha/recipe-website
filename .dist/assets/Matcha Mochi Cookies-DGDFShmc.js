const o=`# Matcha Mochi Cookies

## Notes
The method was written months after the cookies were made so i dont really remember how i did it lmao.  
I used regular glutinous rice flour but you will probably get better mochi if you use flour specifically for mochi like mochiko.  
## Ingredients
### Main
#### Cookie
Flour,  180g  
Butter (softened),  100g  
Brown Sugar,  100g  
Egg,  1 large  
Matcha Powder,  2 tsp  
Baking Soda,  1 tsp  
Choc Chips,  about 5 per cookie, just get a small bag  
#### Mochi
Glutinous Rice Four,  6 tbsp (50g)  
Corn Starch,  4 tsp  
White Sugar,  4 tsp (20g)  
Milk,  1/3 cup  
Butter,  1 Tbsp (15g)  

## Method
1. Preheat oven to 180C.  
2. Mix the glutinous rice flour, sugar and milk in a microwave safe bowl.  
3. Microwave in 30 second increments until solid. You can stop when its just about all solid, carry over cooking will cook the remaining.  
4. Get a large rolling pin or similar instrument you can bash the mochi with. Pound it for 5 mins while incorporating butter to develop its chewiness.  
5. Transfer from bowl onto a cornstarch lined tray. Coat both sides with cornstarch to prevent drying out.  
6. Whisk butter sugar and egg in a large bowl.  
7. Sift in flour, baking soda and matcha powder. Fold with a spatula to combine.  
8. Make a little ball of mochi and envelop it in the cookie dough.  
9. Gently press it down into a disk and push some choc chips in.  
10. Bake until cooked, forgot how long I baked for.
