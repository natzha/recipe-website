# README

This a test html to read markdown files into HTML using marked

This samples from 
* https://github.com/tanabe/markdown-live-preview
* https://github.com/markedjs/marked

# Running
```
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```


# Notes / Todos
* verify whether we need the marked.min.js file or not

* might need to rework with express for access to local data
    * what if data was not local? maybe ping the github page and get the file names
    * would we need github api?
